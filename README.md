#Introduction

This endeavor serves as a platform for me to rejuvenate my proficiency in Java, particularly with Spring Boot. I have successfully implemented containerization and experimented with Kafka in this project. The project incorporates a rudimentary Kafka system designed to extract customer data and identifiers from the sales orders table. In the event that the data is not located, the system will return a null value. This project is a testament to my ongoing commitment to enhancing and applying my technical skills.

Simply:
docker compose up --build

To stop running containers and also removes the stopped containers as well as any networks that were created
docker compose down
